# HOW TO INSTALL/RUN

* Unzip the 'SkyJump Zipped' folder (in the 'compiled version' folder if you downloaded this from my github page)
* Put the 'SkyJump' folder from there into where-ever you wanted it to be
* Don't remove/rename the 'SaveData' or 'sounds' folders within that folder (unless you want to have a non-functional game)
* Click on the SkyJump.JAR file and run it
* yeah that's it

# HOW TO PLAY

* press the any button to start the game
* left arrow to go left, right arrow to go right
* escape button to bring up the quit prompt
* jump on platforms to go up
* eat doughnuts for extra points
  * (probably counts as cannibalism, seeing as you are a doughnut yourself,
  but it's best to not question stuff like that I guess)
* get an high score
* don't fall down

# SUPER HELPFUL INFORMATIVE TIPS

* sometimes it's not always safe to get a doughnut.
* the playable area wraps around horizontally
* you need to worry about momentum with your sideways movement
* but seriously, try to avoid falling down k thx
